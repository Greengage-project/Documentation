# HOWTO Thematic co-exploration 
This document describes the collaborative process, i.e. set of steps that should be carried out in a logical sequence to co-deliver a thematic co-exploration. Notice that co-production, alternatively known as co-creation, consists of two phases [CO-DESIGN and CO-DELIVERY](https://demo.interlink-project.eu/coprod).   

Importantly, these steps are indicative and there could be different journeys through them, i.e. some may be skipped, and some new steps added if the co-producers of a thematic co-exploration so consider.  

Besides, a thematic co-exploration is a collaborative and iterative process, i.e. several iterations over some of the steps of the collaborative process may be needed.  

There are four main phases that the thematic co-exploration might cover. Probably you already performed some of these phases, or at least some steps of those phases, of this workplan, you can take advantage on that and go for the next one.

# Phase 1: Preparing <a name="phase1"></a> 

 

## 1.1. Theme Selection <a name="task1.1"></a> 

### Responsible 
Pilot owner and PST members.  

### Objective 
The primary objective of this step is to formulate precise research questions and hypotheses that are anchored in the needs and priorities of policy-making for a given area where thematic co-exploration could be advisable. Guided by pilot owners who are part of the PST team and know well what are the priorities of a given Citizen Observatory, an area of interest to research through a thematic co-exploration is chosen. It might be necessary to get additional stakeholders on board who e.g. are relevant as they provide specific local knowledge or they should have a meaningful role in the innovation of governance processes.  

The devised research questions and hypotheses should be actionable, measurable, and capable of being empirically tested within the thematic co-exploration’s scope. They should be designed to fill knowledge gaps, address current challenges, and generate evidence to translate into effective policy interventions.   

This step will involve a thorough analysis of the current policy landscape, consultation with stakeholders of the GREENGAGE Observatory, and a review of the existing literature to ensure that the research is targeted and relevant. This foundational step sets the stage for the subsequent research and data collection efforts, ensuring that the thematic co-exploration’s outcomes align with the strategic goals of influencing and enabling policy-making.  


### How can we achieve it? 
After having chosen an area of high priority to tackle a thematic co-exploration, guided by the [Thematic Co-Exploration for Citizen Observatory (COb) Specification](https://aitonline.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/HEUGREENGAGE337/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BB2395027-626C-44CC-98DC-124E9DC5750B%7D&file=ThematicCoExplorationSpec.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) document, a group of GREENGAGE Observers (GObs), citizens, civil servants and other stakeholders, who will govern / organise the pilot and moderate the thematic co-exploration, answer, in collaboration with owners of the Citizen Observatory,  the following core questions:  

 
 - WHY – Reason why this Citizen Observatory’ thematic co-exploration is needed (arguments for promoting the execution of this Citizen Observatory’s campaign)  

 - WHO – different and affected stakeholders’ groups in Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration (describe the target groups and their possible motivation)  

 - WHAT – Actual endeavours of the Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration (describe what will exactly be done in this Citizen Observatory)  

 - WHEN – Planning of activities and period when Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration will be executed (indicate for how long, what activities, where and for whom will be realized)  

 - WHERE – Geographical locations where Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration will take place (actual geographical areas where data collection and analysis will be carried out)  

 - WHICH – Materials and resources (actual materials and resources needed to execute the Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration)  

 - HOW – Data analysis process to be able to capture, analyse and generate indicators and visualizations sought in Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration

It is paramount that the first questions of this document are filled in. It is the WHAT question the one that actually addresses the following aspects essential to start with the co-production of a thematic co-exploration:  

 

 - The problem (describe the problem statement and the challenge that you are addressing)  

 - Objectives (describe the intended result)  

 - Added value (describe the potential benefits for the Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration’s stakeholders)  

 - Current and desired situation (describe the current approach including existing practices, and the desired situation)  

 - CS hypothesis and research questions (to be validated by the outcomes of the execution of the Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration)  

 - Metrics definition (of indicators of success for the Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration)  

 

Notice that some additional optional resources are listed below which could be used before filling in the thematic co-exploration’s specification, to help narrowing the problem and reflecting about the suitability of the problem to be addressed through a thematic co-exploration.

It is designed to compile all the information needed to get started with a thematic co-exploration. It gets information from the CONCEPTUALISING and PREPARING phases of the GREENGAGE methodology for Citizen Observatories.   

 

 

## 1.2. Internal (Pilot Owner) training & preparing <a name="task1.2"></a> 

 

### Responsible 

Pilot owners with the support of the PST. 

 

### Objective 

The objectives of this task is to empower pilot owners with a deep understanding of the capabilities and resources provided by the GREEN Engine, facilitating the strategic planning and execution of thematic co-explorations. A key goal is to compile a comprehensive and organized inventory of datasets relevant to the thematic area of exploration. This inventory will not only catalog existing datasets but also identify critical data gaps that cannot be filled by existing resources. Addressing these gaps is crucial for the thorough examination of the thematic area and for generating actionable insights. To fill these gaps, the strategy includes mobilizing citizen participation in data gathering campaigns. By leveraging the collective effort and unique perspectives of citizens, the initiative aims to enrich the dataset inventory with valuable, real-world data. 

 

### How can we achieve it? 

To optimize the integration of technology in thematic co-explorations, pilot owners will first identify relevant technologies offered by the GREEN Engine that align with their exploration objectives. Subsequently, tailored practical training sessions will be conducted for each selected technology, ensuring pilot owners are equipped with the necessary operational skills and knowledge. These sessions are designed to be hands-on, focusing on the functionalities, data management, and application of technologies pertinent to their specific needs. This approach ensures efficient learning and preparation, enabling pilot owners to effectively leverage these technologies to enhance data collection, analysis, and the overall success of their thematic explorations, thereby contributing to impactful insights and policy-making. 

 

Furthermore, PST members  should comprehensively identify all existing and potential datasets within the scope of the Citizen Observatory and, particularly, those needed for the thematic co-exploration considered. This step aims to create an inventory of datasets, categorising them based on the current thematic co-exporation’s ID, relevance, data type, source, and intended use. Furthermore, it is essential to specify how each dataset may be retrieved and accessed. This inventory serves as the foundation for the dataset metadata registration process in DataHub. Population of Dataset with the newly created inventory is the final action within this step.  

 

### Resources 

 - [Dataset Inventory template](https://aitonline.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/HEUGREENGAGE337/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B632ec461-1851-463e-87de-01eedb9d2263%7D&action=edit&wdinitialsession=c2406669-913f-4a32-b5b5-3334b3429bd4&wdrldsc=2&wdrldc=1&wdrldr=OnSaveAsWebMethodComplete) – knowledge asset with fields  to identify every dataset’s metadata that will be needed for the thematic co-explorations in each Citizen Observatory.

## 1.3. Core Team Onboarding <a name="task1.3"></a> 

 

### Responsible 

Pilot leader with the support of the PST. 

 

### Objective 

To build a solid foundation for thematic co-explorations, the first objective involves creating a comprehensive map of potential stakeholders who could contribute significantly to the Core Team or join the ranks of the GREENGAGE Observers. This mapping will identify key individuals and organizations whose expertise, interests, and resources align with the goals of the exploration, ensuring a diverse and skilled team that can address the project's multifaceted challenges. Following this strategic identification, the second objective focuses on the onboarding of approximately 15 individuals who will play a crucial role in Phase 2 of the exploration. This group will be meticulously selected based on their potential to contribute to the project's success, ensuring they possess the necessary skills, knowledge, and enthusiasm. The onboarding process will equip them with a thorough understanding of the project objectives, methodologies, and expected outcomes, preparing them to effectively contribute to the collaborative efforts required for the exploration's success. Together, these objectives aim to establish a strong, collaborative team capable of driving the project forward through its critical early phases. 

 

### How can we achieve it? 

To achieve the objectives, the PST will work closely with the pilot leader to identify and engage potential stakeholders who could contribute to the thematic co-exploration. This will involve the strategic mapping of stakeholders, identifying their roles, interests, and potential contributions to the project by filling the [Stakeholder Mapping Canvas](https://demo.greengage-project.eu/dashboard/interlinkers/a976a58e-60c7-40c4-9af3-ceec2db08277).  

 

Following this to facilitate discussions and community engagement, Discourse will be integrated, providing a modern and user-friendly forum for exchange and collaboration. In parallel, WordPress will serve as our content management system, offering a versatile platform for information dissemination and interaction with the broader community. Through these platforms, the way in which the interested stakeholders can join and contribute to the thematic co-exploration will be communicated (following all the GDPR and ethical guidelines).  

 

Finally, a first workshop will be organized to onboard the Core Team, specifically designed for the Core Team, aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of the pilot's objectives, the governance model, and presenting a preliminary draft of the forthcoming steps. This session serves as a crucial platform for aligning the team's understanding and expectations, fostering an environment of open communication and collaboration from the outset. It is an opportunity not only to introduce team members to the broader vision and operational framework of the pilot but also to engage in a dialogue that encourages feedback, suggestions, and collective brainstorming.

## 3.3. Data collection <a name="task3.3"></a> 

 

### Responsible 

Pilot Leader of the GOs  

 

### Objective 

This step aims to retrieve the data identified in the previous phase. This data may come from two different sources: 

 - Data that are already available in Open Data portals or provided by Copernicus data. This process will involve the creation of the pipelines (ingestion sources) that will introduce each dataset in DataHub, which will allow us to retrieve the data from the source and store it in the centralised repository. The technical team should create the ingestion sources with the pilot owners' support. 

 - Data that are not available and need to be collected through human collaboration. This process will involve the creation of data gathering campaigns that include missions (tasks) to be completed by the public. The missions will be designed by the thematic co-exploration’s moderators, with the support of the technical team, to retrieve specific data. The missions, thus, the data capture process, will involve using specific tools designed for this task, such as MODE, GREENGAGE app or MindEarth. Notice that mission is a GREENGAGE concept denoting then need to collect certain data in a given area and time period to address a certain data gap identified within a thematic co-exploration. 

 

### How can we achieve it? 

This has to be done in two different ways, depending on the data availability: 

 

#### Data already available 

For the data that is already available, the technical team will create the ingestion sources that will allow the data to be retrieved from the source and stored in the centralised repository. The ingestion sources can be created using Apache NiFi, allowing us to retrieve data from APIs, FTP servers, and other sources. Alternatively, other ingestion sources, such as Python scripts, may require programmatic solutions. Finally, the ingestion sources can also be configured using Apache Druid, allowing us to load data directly into the project's database. The technical team will be responsible for creating the ingestion sources, while the pilot owners will be responsible for providing the necessary information. 

 

#### Data not available 

To achieve this, the missions to collect data should be configured and launched. This process involves Pilot leaders and technical teams that will help them configure the tools that will be used for the data capture process. Once the tools are configured, citizens should be trained to use them. During the operation of the data collection campaigns, the PST members should monitor their progress and performance, and the technical team should ensure that the data is being collected and stored correctly. Data capturing apps and sensors belonging to “Data crowdsourcing and capture layer” of GREEN Engine, such as MODE, GREENGAGE app or MindEarth, will be used to collect the data.

## 3.4. Data combination, analysis & visualization <a name="task3.4"></a> 

 

### Responsible 

Pilot Leader with the support of PST and WP4.  

 

### Objective 

This multifaceted task begins with preprocessing steps to cleanse datasets of any inconsistencies, errors, or irrelevant information using automated data ingestion workflows through tools like Apache NiFi, channeling data efficiently into Apache Druid for optimal analysis readiness. The aim is to maintain data accuracy and integrity for a deeper, more precise understanding critical for informed decision-making. Concurrently, the development of interactive dashboards aims to transform this complex, cleansed data into accessible visual formats, enabling stakeholders—including policymakers, researchers, and citizens—to engage with data themes and patterns in a collaborative exploration environment. These dashboards, providing real-time monitoring and analysis, are crucial for facilitating quick, informed decisions and policy development, while promoting transparency and inclusivity. Together, these objectives strive to simplify data analysis and visualization processes through interlinked datasets and shared schemas, ultimately fostering a shared understanding and enhancing the thematic co-exploration’s impact. 

 

### How can we achieve it? 

To successfully create workflows that can process the data into the desired format we have several ways to do it: creating a NiFi Flow, creating a python script or manually.  

 

 - **NiFi flow:** Apache NiFi is a powerful tool that allows us to create data pipelines that can be scheduled to run periodically. This tool is very useful for data ingestion, as it allows us to fetch data from APIs, FTP servers, and other sources. Additionally, NiFi can be used to clean and transform data, ensuring that it is in the desired format and structure. Finally, NiFi can be used to load data into Apache Druid, ensuring that the data is correctly ingested into the database.  

 

 - **Python script:** Develop Python scripts for more complex data transformations that might not be directly feasible within NiFi. This can include data cleaning, normalization, or feature engineering tasks. It can also be integrated with Apache NiFi to run as part of the flow. Furthermore, by using the Apache Druid API we can directly load data into the database.  

 

 - **Manually:** For simple data transformations, it might be more efficient to perform them manually. This can include tasks such as renaming columns, changing data types, or removing columns. However, this approach is not scalable and should only be used for simple tasks.  

 

Once the data is preprocessed and cleaned the analysis may be conducted by combining and exploring the data using Apache Superset and Apache Druid. Apache Superset will allow us to create and share rich data visualizations and dashboards, providing an intuitive interface for users to interact with the data. Apache Druid will be utilized for its real-time data analytics capabilities, ensuring that our dashboards can display the most current data efficiently. Additionally, the integration of Apache NiFi will streamline the data flow into these systems, ensuring a consistent and reliable data pipeline. The combination of these tools, supported by thorough documentation and examples of integration, will enable us to create dynamic and insightful thematic co-exploration dashboards that serve the diverse needs of our project stakeholders.

## 4.2. Impact on policies <a name="task4.2"></a> 

 

### Responsible 

Pilot Owners, GREENGAGE Observers (GOs), PST.  

 

### Objective 

The generation of policy briefs for policymakers, a key objective of this project step, involves synthesizing research findings and data into clear, concise, and actionable recommendations. These briefs are crafted to effectively communicate pivotal insights and findings to policymakers, providing them with evidence-based guidance for policy interventions. By directly aligning with current policy debates and challenges, these briefs aim to bridge the gap between research and practical policymaking, offering solutions that are grounded in thorough data analysis. This approach not only enhances the relevancy of the research to ongoing policy discussions but also aims to significantly influence policy decisions and strategies, thus amplifying the overall impact of a given thematic co-exploration.  

 

### How can we achieve it? 

To achieve this, we will first aggregate and analyze the data collected and insights generated throughout the project, using tools like Apache Druid for real-time analytics and Apache Superset for data visualization. These tools will help in identifying key trends and findings that are most relevant to policy-making. The policy analysis team will then work closely with research teams to distill these insights into policy briefs, ensuring that they are both data-driven and aligned with current policy needs. Communication specialists will refine these briefs to be clear and compelling, making them accessible to non-specialist policymakers. Throughout this process, a given thematic co-exploration’s coordinators will ensure that the briefs align with the strategic objectives of the thematic co-exploration and effectively convey its potential impact on policy and governance.
