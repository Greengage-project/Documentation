## #2: Registration of available (statistical) and required datasetsâ€™ metadata in DataHub from available and to be generated datasets

### Objective
The primary goal of this step is to establish a comprehensive and organised system for managing datasets relevant to our project. By requiring pilot owners to register both existing and forthcoming datasets, we aim to create a centralised repository of metadata that will serve as a foundational resource for the technical team. This registration process will facilitate the subsequent uploading and integration of these datasets into the project's infrastructure. The overarching objective is to develop a detailed and accessible catalog of data, which will not only streamline project operations but also enhance the efficacy of data analysis and decision-making processes. This initiative is instrumental in ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear and consistent understanding of the available resources, thereby optimising the utilisation and impact of the data within the scope of the project.

### How can we achieve it?  
To achieve the following objective we should follow several steps that will have different teams in charge:

 - **Initial Identification of Datasets (Pilot Owners):** Before the registration process begins, conduct a comprehensive identification of all existing and potential datasets within the scope of the project. This step aim to create an inventory of datasets, categorising them based on relevance, data type, source, and intended use. Furthermore, it is important to specify the way in which each dataset may be retrieved and accessed. This initial inventory will serve as the foundation for the subsequent registration process in DataHub.
 - **Registration of Datasets (Technical Team/Pilot Owners):** Once the datasets are identified, the next step is to register them in DataHub. This process will be conducted by the technical team, with the support of the pilot owners. The registration process will involve the creation of a metadata file for each dataset, which will be uploaded to DataHub. The metadata file will include information such as the dataset's name, description, source, and intended use. The technical team will be responsible for creating the ingestion sources for DataHub, while the pilot owners will be responsible for providing the necessary information.
 - **Dataset Verification & Documentation (Technical Team):** With the datasets registered in Datahub, technical team will be responsible for verifying and validating the data. This process will involve checking if the datasets are registered correctly. The technical team will also be responsible for adding the documentation for each dataset in which the retrieval method is specified. This step is crucial in ensuring that the data is reliable and can be used for analysis and decision-making purposes.
