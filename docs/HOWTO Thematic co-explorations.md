# HOWTO Thematic co-exploration

This document describes  the collaborative process, i.e. set of steps that should be carried out in a logical sequence to co-deliver a thematic co-exploration. Importantly, these steps are indicative and there could be different journeys through them, i.e. some may be skipped and some new steps added if the co-producers of a thematic co-exploration so consider. Besides, a thematic co-exploration is a collaborative and iterative process, i.e. several iterations over some of the steps of the collaborative process may be needed. Indeed, the process indicated below should not be understood as a one way rigid top down process but as an iterative process where some steps may be executed more than once.

## Step 0: Choose thematic co-exploration area and define research questions&hypothesis to be validated to enable policy-making <a name="step0"></a>

#### Responsible
GREENGAGE Observers (GOs) and PST members

#### Objective
The primary objective of this step is to formulate precise research questions and hypotheses that are anchored in the needs and priorities of policy-making for a given area where thematic co-exploration could be advisable. Guided by pilot owners who are part of the PST team and know well what are the priorities of a given Citizen Observatory, an area of itnerest to research through a thematic co-exploration is chosen.

The devised research questions and hypotheses should be actionable, measurable, and capable of being empirically tested within the thematic co-exploration’sscope. They should be designed to fill knowledge gaps, address current challenges, and generate evidence to translate into effective policy interventions. 

This step will involve a thorough analysis of the current policy landscape, consultation with stakeholders of the GREENGAGE Observatory, and a review of the existing literature to ensure that the research is targeted and relevant. This foundational step sets the stage for the subsequent research and data collection efforts, ensuring that the thematic co-exploration’s outcomes align with the strategic goals of influencing and enabling policy-making.

#### How can we achieve it?
After having chosen an area of high priority to tackle a thematic co-exploration, guided by the [Thematic Co-Exploration for Citizen Observatory (COb) Specification](https://aitonline.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/HEUGREENGAGE337/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BB2395027-626C-44CC-98DC-124E9DC5750B%7D&file=ThematicCoExplorationSpec.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) document, a group of GREENGAGE Observers (GObs), citizens, civil servants and other stakeholders, who will manage and moderate the thematic co-exploration, answer, in collaboration with owners of the Citizen Observatory,  the following core questions:
- WHY – Reason why this Citizen Observatory’ thematic co-exploration is needed (arguments for promoting the execution of this Citizen Observatory’s campaign)
- WHO – Involved and affected stakeholders’ groups in Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration (describe the target groups and their possible motivation)
- WHAT – Actual endeavours of the Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration (describe what will exactly be done in this Citizen Observatory)
- WHEN – Planning of activities and period when Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration will be executed (indicate for how long, what activities, where and for whom will be realized)
- WHERE – Geographical locations where Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration will take place (actual geographical areas where data collection and analysis will be carried out)
- WHICH – Materials and resources (actual materials and resources needed to execute the Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration)
- HOW – Data analysis process to be able to capture, analyse and generate indicators and visualizations sought in Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration

The [Thematic Co-Exploration for Citizen Observatory (COb) Specification](https://aitonline.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/HEUGREENGAGE337/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BB2395027-626C-44CC-98DC-124E9DC5750B%7D&file=ThematicCoExplorationSpec.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) document does not need to be completed thoroughly in this step. It is paramount that the first questions of this document are filled in. It is the WHAT question the one that actually addresses the following aspects essential to start with the co-production of a thematic co-exploration:
- The problem (describe the problem statement and the challenge that you are addressing)
- Objectives (describe the intended result)
- Added value (describe the potential benefits for the Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration’s stakeholders)
- Current and desired situation (describe the current approach including existing practices, and the desired situation)
- CS hypothesis and research questions (to be validated by the outcomes of the execution of the Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration)
- Metrics definition (of indicators of success for the Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration)

Notice that some additional optional resources are listed below which could be used before filling in the thematic co-exploration’s specification, to help narrowing the problem and reflecting about the suitability of the problem to be addressed through a thematic co-exploration. 

#### Resources
- [Citizen Science problem statement analysis](https://aitonline.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/HEUGREENGAGE337/Shared%20Documents/WP4%20CO%20enabling%20infrastructure%20and%20interoperable/D4.1%20GREEN%20Engine%20and%20manuals/Academy/resources/Citizen%20Science%20ProblemStatementQuestionnaire.xlsx?d=w2a0a58548f2f41a8821b4ed300a86be2&csf=1&web=1&e=TLG1AL) – this resource allows to perform a minimal viability analysis to determine whether a problem that wants to be tackled is approachable through Citizen Science or not.

It is designed to compile all the information needed to get started with a thematic co-exploration. It gets information from the CONCEPTUALISING and PREPARING phases of the GREENGAGE methodology for Citizen Observatories. 


## Step 1: Preparation of the co-production process, teams and community dialogue mechanism<a name="step1"></a>

#### Responsible
GREENGAGE Observers (GOs) and PST members

#### Objective
The primary objective of this step is to establish a robust and effective co-production process in [GREENGAGE’s Collaborative Environment](https://demo.greengage-project.eu/), that fosters collaborative engagement between various stakeholders within the GREENGAGEObservatory (GO)’s thematic co-exploration. This involves the strategic configuration of various community teams to ensure a diverse representation of perspectives, skills, and expertise. The aim is to create a digital collaboration space where community members, experts, and stakeholders can collectively contribute to the co-production process underlying every thematic co-exploration, leveraging their unique insights and experiences. This process is designed to facilitate the seamless integration of community input into the thematic co-exploration and empower participants by providing them with the tools, training, and support, in the form of GO Enablers, necessary for meaningful participation. The ultimate goal is to enhance the quality, relevance, and impact of the thematic co-exploration’s outcomes through a participatory approach that values and utilises the collective knowledge and capabilities of the GO’s community teams, guided and supported by Pilot Support Team (PST) members, who coach and support them during the usage of technologies and application of the different stages part of the Citizen Science loop.

#### How can we achieve it?
To facilitate discussions and community engagement, Discourse will be integrated, providing a modern and user-friendly forum for exchange and collaboration. In parallel, WordPress will serve as our content management system, offering a versatile platform for information dissemination and interaction with the broader community.  Finally and, most importantly, a new co-production process will be set up in GREENGAGE Collaborative Environment. Hence, the accomplishment of this step requires usage of all the tools belonging to the “Community and co-production process management” layer of GREEN Engine. 
- A new entry should be created within the parent pilot / Citizen Observatory page, for the newly specified thematic co-exploration. The [instructions to use Wordpress](https://greengage-project.github.io/Documentation/tools/wordpress/) should be followed to achieve this.
- A new set of categories for topics of discussion following the instructions of usage of the [Discourse tool](https://greengage-project.github.io/Documentation/tools/Discourse/), should be created by the GObs leading and managing the thematic co-exploration. This will serve to foster the collaboration and dialogue among participants in the thematic co-exploration.
- A new co-production process based on the “GREENGAGE way” co-production process schema or blueprint already loaded into [Collaborative Environment](https://greengage-project.github.io/Documentation/tools/collaborativeEnvironment/) should be instantiated. 

#### Resources
- [WordPress](https://greengage-project.github.io/Documentation/tools/wordpress/) – HOWTO for tool essential to communicate the existance of a thematic co-exploration and allow dissemination of its results to the broader community- [Discourse](https://greengage-project.github.io/Documentation/tools/Discourse/) –  HOWTO for tool necessary to foster discussions and dialogue among GObs and allow them to request help and support each other

## Step 2: Invitation, onboarding and training of selected users to take part in a Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration<a name="step2"></a>
 
#### Responsible
Pilot support team members

#### Objective
A thematic co-exploration is structured to engage and empower citizens, enabling their active involvement in data collection, observation, and analysis. It strives to ensure that contributions from citizens are meaningful and pivotal in addressing key research questions. This step assumes that the following questions have been previously been answered when tackling the WHO question of the [Problem Statement Questionnaire](https://aitonline.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/HEUGREENGAGE337/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B2A0A5854-8F2F-41A8-821B-4ED300A86BE2%7D&file=ProblemStatementQuestionnaire.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) document:
- Who is the **promoter and/or sponsor** of this Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration?
- Who are **responsible for the Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration**?
- Who are the **domain experts and leaders of the Citizen Observatory’s community** to be involved in this thematic co-exploration?
- Who will be the **participants in this CS campaign of the Citizen Observatory** and what will be their **collaborative duties**?
- What **social collectives, influencers, societal representatives** could help you disseminating the outcomes of this Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration?
- Who will be the **multi stakeholder members affected** by the Citizen Observatory’s **thematic co-exploration’s results**?

#### How can we achieve it?
To achieve the objectives, the Collaborative Environment will be the key to enhanced collaboration and asset management and will be instrumental in coordinating the efforts of different stakeholders and managing campaign assets effectively. Indeed, different teams of stakeholder types will be configured in the environment and granted different rights over the phases, objectives and tasks of the co-production process. The thematic co-exploration promoters will co-design different communication assets based on the templates in the form of knowledge assets or GO enablers already loaded into the Collaborative Environment. 

For community engagement and discussion, Discourse will serve as our primary platform, fostering a space for open, structured communication among participants. Groups for each co-producer team will be assembled in the tool. Several topics to foster onboarding and training for the new thematic co-exploration will be promoted through Discourse. 

Training materials for the following topics have been made ready by the project and should be extended and customized for each thematic co-exploration:
- Data I
- Data II
- Co-design I
- Co-design II
- Co-design III
- Air quality & Mobility Monitoring
- Technology I
- Technology II
- Technology III
- Policy-making & Governance
- Analysis & Visualisation

## Step 3: Inventory of available datasets and data gaps identification to explore a problem domain<a name="step3"></a>

#### Responsible:
PST members  and GREENGAGE Observers (GOs)

#### Objective
The primary goal of this step is to establish a comprehensive and organised system for managing datasets relevant to a thematic co-exploration. By requiring pilot owners to register existing and forthcoming datasets, we aim to create a centralised metadata repository that will serve as a foundational resource for the technical team being able to access, explore and analyse the data to be compiled for the thematic co-exploration. This registration process will facilitate the subsequent uploading and integration of these datasets into the GREENGAGE infrastructure for its usage by the thematic co-explorations of a given Citizen Observatory. The aim of this step  is to develop a detailed and accessible catalogue of data, for the whole Citizen Observatory and where datasets will be categorized according to the thematic co-exploration they belong to, which will so streamline thematic co-exploration’s operations and enhance the efficacy of data analysis and decision-making processes. This initiative is instrumental in ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear and consistent understanding of the available data resources, thereby optimising the utilisation and impact of the data within a given Citizen Observatory’s s scope. Importantly, during the preparation of each thematic co-exploration, GObs will also contribute with new entries, categorized and linked to such thematic co-exploration, within the centralised catalogue of datasets in a Citizen Observatory.

#### How can we achieve it?  
To achieve the following objective, PST members  should comprehensively identify all existing and potential datasets within the scope of the Citizen Observatory and, particularly, those needed for the thematic co-exploration considered. This step aims to create an inventory of datasets, categorising them based on the current thematic co-exporation’s ID, relevance, data type, source, and intended use. Furthermore, it is essential to specify how each dataset may be retrieved and accessed. This inventory serves as the foundation for the dataset metadata registration process in DataHub. Population of Dataset with the newly created inventory is the final action within this step.

#### Resources
- [Dataset Inventory template](https://aitonline.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/HEUGREENGAGE337/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B632ec461-1851-463e-87de-01eedb9d2263%7D&action=edit&wdinitialsession=c2406669-913f-4a32-b5b5-3334b3429bd4&wdrldsc=2&wdrldc=1&wdrldr=OnSaveAsWebMethodComplete) – knowledge asset with fields  to identify every dataset’s metadata that will be needed for the thematic co-explorations in each Citizen Observatory. It is recommended that for each thematic co-exploration a a copy of this template is performed and filled in.
- [DataHub](https://greengage-project.github.io/Documentation/tools/datahub/) – HOWTO for tool used to register, search and view metatada about what datasets of a given thematic area are already available in the catalogue of such Citizen Observatory. The dataset inventory template completed for a given thematic co-exploration shoudl be used as input to complete the datasets metadata in DataHub.


## Step 4: Co-preparation of the thematic co-exploration to make it ready for launch<a name="step4"></a>

#### Responsible
PST members and GREENGAGE Observers (GOs)

#### Objective 
The core objective of this task is to get the community of observers, their collaboration process management, the tools and reources needed for the succesful execution of the thematic co-exploration ready for operation. It will entail completing the following steps: 
- Select GREENGAGE tools and knowledge assets to co-produce thematic co-exploration
- Agree on indicators, metrics and methods for measurement needed
- Define data protocol to be used in thematic co-exploration
- Adapt selected tools for data management 
- Adapt selected communication and evaluation materials
- Test process and community management tools
- Test data capture tools and instruments
- Test data analysis tools and visualizations
- Test monitoring and evaluation instruments 
- Test community support mechanisms
- Report lessons learnt and improvements needed detected in the preparation process
- Planning of work activities and engagement events for execution and evaluation

Once all the steps above listed are completed, it can be considered that the GO’s thematic co-exploration is ready for operation and evaluation. Central to GREENGAGE  is the utilisation of innovative digital tools and platforms, which are devised for efficient data collection, management, and analysis. Besides, in GREENGAGE it is aimed to foster a community spirit and shared purpose among participants, thereby enhancing their understanding and engagement in scientific research. This approach is expected to yield reliable and high-quality data, instrumental in influencing policy-making, supporting community initiatives, and furthering scientific inquiries. Additionally, the CS campaign or thematic co-exploration co-designed should be scalable, replicable, and adaptable to a variety of contexts and research domains, setting a model for future citizen science endeavours.

#### How can we achieve it?
To realize this step, the Collaborative Environment (CE) and the “GREENGAGE way” blueprint instantiated for the thematic co-exploration, should guide the  interaction and management of the campaign's activities. In this process, Discourse will also be used for community engagement and open communication, facilitating a structured and inclusive dialogue among participants. For data collection, tools such as GREENGAGE app, MindEarth app, or  sensors for environmental monitoring will be employed. The data collected will be organized and analyzed using DataHub, Apache Superset, and Apache Druid for advanced data storage, analysis and visualization. Apache NiFi will be instrumental in ensuring a streamlined and efficient data processing pipelines. The synergy of these tools and platforms, as specified in our technical guide (layers “Community and co-production process management”, “Data crowdsourcing and capture” and “Data analysis and insights generation”), will ensure a comprehensive, secure, and effective Citizen Science campaign, addressing the research questions while empowering citizen participants.

Once more, the [Problem Statement Questionnaire](https://aitonline.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/HEUGREENGAGE337/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B2A0A5854-8F2F-41A8-821B-4ED300A86BE2%7D&file=ProblemStatementQuestionnaire.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) document should be revisited. This time special attention should be paid to sections:
- WHEN – Planning of activities and period when Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration will be executed
- WHERE – Geographical locations where Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration will take place (actual geographical areas where data collection and analysis will be carried out)
- WHICH – Materials and resources (actual materials and resources needed to execute the Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration)
- HOW – Data analysis process to be able to capture, analyse and generate indicators and visualizations sought in Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration

Each of the above mentioned tools contains a page in the [Technical guide for GREENGAGE](https://greengage-project.github.io/Documentation/). Thematic co-exploration’s participants guided by the PST should choose the best fitting tools for the considered thematic co-exploration. Following the examples included in each tool page, they should configure the tools and test their readiness for being used during the operation of the thematic co-exploration. 

Besides, a selection and adaptation of the materials/knowledge assets defined at [Knowledge Base](https://www.greengage-project.eu/knowledge-base/) of the main project’s website and also in the internal catalogue of the CE should be performed. Some of those materials should be adapted to the thematic co-exploration in stake. 

The evaluation strategy of the thematic co-exploration should be defined. This entails that KPIs are defined and evaluation mechanisms to populate such KPIs also defined. This will entail the design of evaluation questionnaires based on those already designed by the project and the collection of logs or issuing queries over the GREENGAGE and external tools used in the thematic co-exploration. 

Finally, detailed planning for the thematic co-exploration’s piloting and the engagement plan to ensure continuous involvement of community members should also be established.

## Step 5: Management of data workflow process for the thematic co-exploration<a name="step5"></a>

#### Responsible
PST members and GREENGAGE Observers (GOs) with technical skills

#### Objective
This step aims to establish a robust and efficient data management process for the Citizen Science campaign or thematic co-exploration. This process will involve the planning of data collection based on the data identified in [Step 3](#step3). The data management plan should depict the data collection process for each dataset, the stakeholders involved in their collection, and the tools and platforms used. Furthermore, the plan should include the workflow that will be followed for each dataset, from collection to analysis and visualisation. Through this process, the technical team and the PST will have a well-defined and structured plan for each dataset, facilitating the subsequent steps.

The following aspects of data management for the thematic co-exploration will be defined at this step and its substeps:
- Data **protocol for your Citizen Observatory’s** thematic co-exploration:
  - What type of data do you need?
  - Does it involve objective or subjective measurements?
  - Do you focus on one or more parameters?
  - Does it involve creating a new dataset or adding to an existing dataset?
  - What is the geographical and temporal scope of the data collection process?
  - Do you need a representative sample?
  - How will participants have to collect the data: via one or several measuring instruments?
- Analytical **methods** which should be applied within the Citizen Observatory’s thematic co-exploration.
- Visualization and **metrics to generate to support the decision-making** through Citizen Observatory’s realization.

#### How can we achieve it?
PST members and the technical members of the thematic co-exploration’s participants should work together to fulfil a template that defines the data management plan for each dataset in the data inventory realised in [Step 3](#step3). 

#### Resources
- [Data Management Plan Template](https://aitonline.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/HEUGREENGAGE337/Shared%20Documents/WP4%20CO%20enabling%20infrastructure%20and%20interoperable/D4.1%20GREEN%20Engine%20and%20manuals/Academy/resources/Libro.xlsx?d=w0a19b821efd94d55ba8f50d10bd6fd17&csf=1&web=1&e=XEUvCF) –  to define the data management plan for each dataset and the associated data protocol to be followed by observers


### Step 5a: Gather Copernicus and Open Data from government datasets to gain bird's eye view for thematic co-exploration<a name="step5a"></a>

#### Responsible
PST members and GREENGAGE Observers (GOs) with technical skills

#### Objective
This step aims to retrieve the datasets identified in [Step 3](#step3) that are already available in Open Data portals or provided by [Copernicus data](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/access-data). This process will involve the creation of ingestion sources for each dataset in DataHub, which will allow us to retrieve the data from the source and store it in the centralised repository. The technical team should create the ingestion sources with the pilot owners' support.

#### How can we achieve it?
This step can be achieved in many ways depending on the data source to be retrieved. The ingestion sources can be created using Apache NiFi, allowing us to retrieve data from APIs, FTP servers, and other sources. Alternatively, other ingestion sources, such as Python scripts, may require programmatic solutions. Finally, the ingestion sources can also be configured  using Apache Druid, allowing us to load data directly into the project's database. The technical team will be responsible for creating the ingestion sources, while the pilot owners will be responsible for providing the necessary information.

#### Resources

### Step 5b: Organise and gather crowdsourcing of data by citizens through data capture apps<a name="step5b"></a>

#### Responsible
PST members and GREENGAGE Observers (GOs) with technical skills

#### Objective
This step aims to design and implement a data crowdsourcing  campaigns to collect data through human collaborationidentified, as data gaps, in [Step 3](#step3). This process will involve the creation of data gathering campaigns that include missions (tasks) to be completed by the public. The missions will be designed by the thematic co-exploration’s moderators, with the support of the technical team, to retrieve specific data. The missions, thus, the data capture process, will involve using specific tools designed for this task, such as MODE, GREENGAGE app or MindEarth. Notice that mission is a GREENGAGE concept denoting then need to collect certain data in a given area and time period to address a certain data gap identified within a thematic co-exploration.

#### How can we achieve it?
First, the thematic co-exploration’s moderators should identify and design the missions that citizens will have to complete to collect the data. Then, together with the technical team, they will configure the tools that will be used for the data capture process. Once the tools are configured and citizens trained to use them (allegedly carried out in *Step 2*), the data crowdsourcing campaigns should be launched and promoted. During the operation of the campaigns, the PST members should monitor their progress and performance, and the technical team should ensure that the data is being collected and stored correctly. Data capturing apps and sensors belonging to “Data crowdsourcing and capture layer” of GREEN Engine, such as MODE, GREENGAGE app or MindEarth, will be used to collect the data.

## Step 6: Cataloguing and storage of captured data<a name="step6"></a>

#### Responsible
PST members and GREENGAGE Observers (GOs) with technical skills

### Objective
This step aims to maintain and continuously populate a centralised repository of metadata for all datasets within the scope of the GO, where datasets are tagged according to the thematic co-explorations where they apply. This repository will serve as a foundational resource for the stakeholders working in the GO, enabling them to manage and analyse the data efficiently. The process will involve the registration of datasets in DataHub, a centralised metadata platform that will act as a single source of truth for all project data. Furthermore, DataHub allows us to add documentation and metadata for each dataset catalogued this way. On the other hand, this step entails storing and/or configuring data access and query mechanisms to the datasets considered, with the support of Apache Druid.

### How can we achieve it?  
Althoughthe datasets were identified in [Step 3](#step3) and some already  is registered in DataHub, it is now time to revise and enrich the catalogue with the final datasets’ metadata that will be used during the analysis of data. The technical team will conduct this process with the support of the pilot owners. The registration process will involve the creation or update (if already existed) of a metadata file for each dataset, which will be uploaded to DataHub. The metadata file will include information such as the dataset's name, description, source, and intended use (thematic co-explorations where it will be used). The technical team will be responsible for creating the ingestion sources for DataHub, while the pilot owners will be responsible for providing the necessary information.

Besides, technical participants in the thematic co-exploration aided by the PST will configure mechanisms to store, access and query the gathered data through Apache Druid.

## Step 7: Generation of data analysis workflows (Data cleaning, pipelining and analysis)<a name="step7"></a>

#### Responsible: 
PST members and GREENGAGE Observers (GOs) with technical skills

#### Objective
The objective of this step is a critical phase in the data management process, primarily focused on ensuring the quality and usability of datasets within the project's framework. This stage involves a series of preprocessing steps designed to cleanse the datasets, removing any inconsistencies, errors, or irrelevant information that might hinder analysis. Since some datasets are updated daily, it's essential to establish automated data ingestion workflows, using tools like Apache NiFi, to streamline the continuous flow of data into the main data store, namely Apache Druid. This approach facilitates the efficient and reliable updating of data and ensures that the datasets are in an optimal format and structure for analysis. The ultimate goal of this process is to enhance data accuracy and integrity, thereby enabling a deeper and more accurate understanding of the data, which is vital for informed decision-making and insightful analysis within the project. The outcome of this process will be a set of correlated datasets conveniently interlinked and using shared schemas so that the data analysis and visualization steps can be simplified.

#### How can we achieve it?
To successfully create workflows that can process the data into the desired format we have several ways to do it: creating a NiFi Flow, creating a python script or manually.
- **NiFi flow:** Apache NiFi is a powerful tool that allows us to create data pipelines that can be scheduled to run periodically. This tool is very useful for data ingestion, as it allows us to fetch data from APIs, FTP servers, and other sources. Additionally, NiFi can be used to clean and transform data, ensuring that it is in the desired format and structure. Finally, NiFi can be used to load data into Apache Druid, ensuring that the data is correctly ingested into the database.
- **Python script:** Develop Python scripts for more complex data transformations that might not be directly feasible within NiFi. This can include data cleaning, normalization, or feature engineering tasks. It can also be integrated with Apache NiFi to run as part of the flow. Furthermore, by using the Apache Druid API we can directly load data into the database.
- **Manually:** For simple data transformations, it might be more efficient to perform them manually. This can include tasks such as renaming columns, changing data types, or removing columns. However, this approach is not scalable and should only be used for simple tasks.

Once the data is preprocessed and cleaned the analysis may be conducted by combining and exploring the data using Apache Superset and Apache Druid. Apache Superset is a powerful tool that allows us to create interactive dashboards and visualizations that will be explained in the next step. Apache Druid allows us to perform real-time analytics on large datasets. These tools will be used to explore the data and generate insights that will be used to answer the research questions.

The objective of generating thematic co-exploration dashboards step of a thematic co-exploration is to develop interactive and insightful tools that transform complex data into accessible visual formats, enhancing comprehension and insight. These dashboards are designed to enable stakeholders, including policymakers, researchers, and citizens, to delve into various data themes and patterns, fostering an environment of collaborative exploration and dialogue. By providing real-time data monitoring and analysis, these dashboards will be instrumental in supporting quick and informed decision-making and policy development. The overarching goal is to ensure transparency and open access to a given thematic co-exploration’s data, thereby promoting inclusive participation and a shared understanding among all project participants.

#### How can we achieve it?
To accomplish this, we will leverage tools like Apache Superset and Apache Druid, as outlined in [GREENGAGE’s technical documentation](https://greengage-project.github.io/Documentation/). Apache Superset will allow us to create and share rich data visualizations and dashboards, providing an intuitive interface for users to interact with the data. Apache Druid will be utilized for its real-time data analytics capabilities, ensuring that our dashboards can display the most current data efficiently. Additionally, the integration of Apache NiFi will streamline the data flow into these systems, ensuring a consistent and reliable data pipeline. The combination of these tools, supported by thorough documentation and examples of integration, will enable us to create dynamic and insightful thematic co-exploration dashboards that serve the diverse needs of our project stakeholders.

#### Objective
The objective in the "Generation of storylines for wide dissemination" phase is to craft engaging and accessible narratives that convey the thematic co-exploration's key findings and insights to a broad audience. These storylines are designed to translate complex data and research outcomes into formats that are both engaging and easily understandable by the public. The aim is to underscore the thematic co-exploration's significance and its potential impact on policy-making, community initiatives, and scientific research. By doing so, the goal is to foster increased public awareness and interest in the project, thereby enhancing its overall reach and influence. To achieve wide visibility and impact, these storylines will be disseminated through various media channels, tailored to resonate with diverse audience segments, thereby ensuring the project's findings are communicated effectively and broadly.

#### How can we achieve it?
To effectively generate storylines for wide dissemination, we will utilize a range of tools specified in our project documentation. The Communications and Outreach Team will collaborate closely with the Data Analysis Team, utilizing Apache Superset for creating compelling data visualizations that bring complex data to life in an easily digestible format. These visual elements will be integral in crafting storylines that are both informative and engaging to the public. Additionally, we will leverage WordPress and Discourse platforms to draft, refine, and share these narratives, ensuring they are tailored to resonate with diverse audience segments. The integration of these tools will enable us to effectively communicate the thematic co-exploration's impact and findings through various media channels, from social media to press releases, thereby maximizing reach and fostering greater public engagement with the project's outcomes.

## Step 10: Generation of policy briefs' inputs for policy makers<a name="step10"></a>

#### Responsible
Policy Analysis Team, Pilot Owners and GREENGAGE Observers (GOs)

#### Objective
The generation of policy briefs for policymakers, a key objective of this project step, involves synthesizing research findings and data into clear, concise, and actionable recommendations. These briefs are crafted to effectively communicate pivotal insights and findings to policymakers, providing them with evidence-based guidance for policy interventions. By directly aligning with current policy debates and challenges, these briefs aim to bridge the gap between research and practical policymaking, offering solutions that are grounded in thorough data analysis. This approach not only enhances the relevancy of the research to ongoing policy discussions but also aims to significantly influence policy decisions and strategies, thus amplifying the overall impact of a given thematic co-exploration.

#### How can we achieve it?
To achieve this, we will first aggregate and analyze the data collected and insights generated throughout the project, using tools like Apache Druid for real-time analytics and Apache Superset for data visualization. These tools will help in identifying key trends and findings that are most relevant to policy-making. The policy analysis team will then work closely with research teams to distill these insights into policy briefs, ensuring that they are both data-driven and aligned with current policy needs, as were identified in *Step 0*. Communication specialists will refine these briefs to be clear and compelling, making them accessible to non-specialist policymakers. Throughout this process, a given thematic co-exploration’s coordinators will ensure that the briefs align with the strategic objectives of the thematic co-exploration and effectively convey its potential impact on policy and governance.
