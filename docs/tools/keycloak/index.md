1. The User initiates the process by requesting a page from the Application.
2. The Application then redirects the User to a browser for authentication.
3. The browser initiates an Authentication Request to Keycloak.
4. Keycloak presents a Login Page to the User.
5. The User enters their credentials into the login page.
6. The credentials are submitted back to Keycloak for validation.
7. Upon successful validation, Keycloak redirects the User back to the Application.
8. The Application makes a Token Request to Keycloak.
9. Keycloak validates the request and, if valid, returns a Token to the Application.
10. With the Token, the User is granted access to the requested page within the Application.
