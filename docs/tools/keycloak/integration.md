**Step 2: Receiving Your Credentials**

- Upon receipt of your request, we will review the information and create a unique Client ID and Secret for your service.
- We will then send you an email with your Client ID and Secret, which you will use to configure the integration on your side.

**Step 3: Configuring Your Service**

- Once you have received your Client ID and Secret, incorporate these credentials into your serviceâ€™s authentication module.
- Ensure that your service is set to communicate with our Keycloak server using the OpenID Connect protocol.

**Step 4: Testing the Integration**

- After configuring your service, conduct thorough testing to ensure that the authentication process works correctly.
- If you encounter any issues during testing, please reach out to us via email for support.
