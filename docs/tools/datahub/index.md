# DataHub
## DataHub Description

### Introduction

#### Description
DataHub is an open-source metadata platform designed to democratise data discovery. It acts as a centralised system for companies and teams to track, manage, and find data within their organisation. Its primary aim is to streamline the process of accessing and understanding data assets, making it easier for teams to derive insights and make informed decisions.
#### Objective
The primary objective of DataHub is to facilitate better data discovery and management. By offering a unified view of an organisation's data assets, it aims to enhance collaboration, data governance, and compliance, while reducing the time and effort spent in locating and understanding data resources.
### Features of Datahub
- **Metadata Management:** DataHub catalogs metadata from various data sources, offering insights into data quality, usage, and lineage.
- **Search and Discovery:** It provides powerful search capabilities, allowing users to quickly find datasets and understand their context.
- **Data Lineage:** Visual representation of data lineage helps in understanding how data is transformed and where it flows within the organisation.
- **Data Observability:** Monitors data health, alerting users to issues related to data quality and freshness.
- **Access Control:** Supports granular access control to manage who can view or edit different data assets.
- **Extensibility:** Offers APIs and an extensible architecture, allowing for customisation and integration with other tools and systems.

### Use Case Scenario

DataHub is employed to bridge the gap between citisens, scientists, and open data portals. Pilots have a wealth of open data available â€“ traffic patterns, pollution levels, public space usage, and more.

With DataHub, the city creates a centralised, user-friendly platform where all this data is cataloged and made easily searchable. Citisens and local scientists can access this data to understand various aspects of the city's dynamics. For instance, a group of citisens concerned about air quality uses DataHub to find and analyse pollution data. 

Furthermore, DataHub can be used to track the lineage of data, allowing users to understand how data is transformed and where it flows within the organisation. This helps in ensuring data quality and compliance with regulations such as GDPR.
