# Apache NiFi

Apache NiFi it's not directly integrated into other software tools in the traditional sense of built-in connectors or plugins, NiFi excels in interfacing with a wide range of systems and services through its extensive library of processors. These processors are adept at *'getting'* data from various sources and *'putting'* processed data to numerous destinations. For example, NiFi can extract data from web services, databases, file systems, and even message queues, process this data according to defined rules and workflows, and then deliver the processed data to different systems, locations, or storage solutions. This flexibility in interacting with external systems is achieved not through direct integration, but by leveraging NiFi's ability to handle diverse data formats and communication protocols, making it a powerful intermediary in any data-centric architecture.
