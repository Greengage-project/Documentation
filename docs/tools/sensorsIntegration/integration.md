The importance of using MQTT connectors in the project is highlighted by the need to establish efficient and standardized communication in an environment where various technologies converge. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) stands out as a lightweight and robust protocol that enables real-time data transmission between devices, ensuring seamless connectivity in heterogeneous environments. In the context of air quality monitoring, data standardization through MQTT facilitates the integration of devices from different manufacturers and technologies, promoting interoperability and simplifying the development of IoT architecture. The efficiency of MQTT is particularly evident in the effective management of messages, minimizing bandwidth and optimizing the transmission of critical information about sensors. Thus, the choice of MQTT connectors not only improves the coherence and speed of communication but also establishes a solid foundation for scalability and future system expansion, ensuring robustness and reliability in projects that require efficient real-time data management.

**Step 1: Requesting Access Credentials**

- Instructions on how to request access credentials.

  - To get started with your MQTT broker, please contact a.pujante@libelium.com

**Step 2: Receiving Credentials**

- Once you have your MQTT connector, the next step is to integrate it into your platform or architecture in order to be able to receive the data on it

**Step 4: Testing the Integration**

- To check the integration, it will be necessary to see if the data is arriving correctly to the       platform and can be displayed correctly..
