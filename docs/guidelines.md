### Comprehensive Guidelines for Documenting and Integrating Tools

#### 1. Duplicating the Documentation Template

- **Action**: Begin by duplicating the folder `docs/tools/TOOLNAME_template`.
- **Purpose**: This template serves as a foundational structure for documenting new tools, ensuring consistency across your documentation.

#### 2. Describing the Tool in `index.md`

- **Content Requirements**: In `index.md`, offer a comprehensive overview of the tool. This should include its purpose, key features, and any unique aspects that make it beneficial for your project.
- **Incorporating External Documentation**: If there are external resources or official documentation for the tool, link them. This helps users understand the broader context and capabilities of the tool. They should be listed in the References section at the end of index.md, check the template provided. Notice that resources like images or PDFs should be stored in subfolder assets. 
- **Example Structure**:

  ```markdown
  # Tool Name

  ## Introduction to Tool Name

  [Detailed introduction, including the tool's purpose and general functionality.]

  ## Features

  [Detailed list of features, explaining how each aspect adds value to the project.]

  ## Use Case Illustration

  ![Use Case Diagram](./assets/use_case.png)

  [Detailed description of a use case, demonstrating how the tool integrates into workflows or solves specific problems.]
  ```

#### 3. Integration Guide in `integration.md`

- **Content**: Provide a clear, step-by-step guide for integrating the tool with third-party services. Remember provide a channel to ask for support about the tool.
- **Structure**:
  - **Requesting Credentials**: Outline the process for obtaining necessary access credentials.
  - **Configuration Steps**: Detail the steps for integrating the tool within their systems, including any specific settings or parameters.
  - **Testing and Validation**: Emphasize the importance of testing the integration and provide guidance on troubleshooting common issues.

#### 4. Proof of Concept Code in `examples`

- **Purpose**: Supply ready-to-use code examples in various programming languages to demonstrate practical integration.
- **Details**: Each example should include comprehensive comments explaining each step and its relevance to the integration process.

#### 5. Documenting Examples in `examples/index.md`

- **Structure**: For each example, include prerequisites, a detailed walkthrough of the project structure, and step-by-step instructions for setup and execution.
- **Clarity**: Ensure that the instructions are clear, concise, and suitable for users with varying levels of expertise.

#### 6. Summarizing Tool in `docs/index.md`

- **Overview**: Provide a brief yet informative summary of the tool, highlighting its significance and utility within the project.
- **Example Entry**:

  ```markdown
  ### Tool Name

  - **Directory**: `/tools/toolname`
  - **Documentation Link**: [Tool Documentation](tools/toolname)
  - **Description**: A concise summary highlighting the key features and benefits of the tool. Insight into how it integrates with and enhances the project.
    - [Integration Example: Node.js](/tools/toolname/examples#Nodejs)
    - [Integration Example: Python](/tools/toolname/examples#Python)
  ```

These guidelines aim to provide a thorough and user-friendly approach to documenting and integrating tools, thereby enhancing the accessibility and usability of your project's documentation.
