# Technical Guide for GREENGAGE Project Integration

### Project

The GREENGAGE project is a three-year-long pan-European initiative aimed at strengthening urban governance through citizen-based co-creation and crowd-sourcing. Funded under the Horizon Europe Framework Programme and co-funded by the UK government and Switzerland's State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation, this project is led by the Austrian Institute of Technology and comprises 17 research and industry partners from the EU and the UK. The project seeks to encourage innovative governance processes and assist public authorities in formulating climate mitigation and adaptation policies. By leveraging citizen participation and providing innovative digital solutions, GREENGAGE lays the groundwork for co-creating and co-designing innovative solutions to monitor environmental issues at the grassroots level. The developed Citizen Observatories (CO) are intended to be further integrated into urban planning decision-making processes. The project encompasses campaigns in four pilot cities across Europe, focusing on mobility, air quality, and healthy living, with citizens encouraged to observe and co-create data solutions for urban environments through Citizen Observatories.
