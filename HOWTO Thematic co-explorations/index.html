<h4 id="responsible_9">Responsible:</h4>
<p>Technical Team</p>
<h4 id="objective_9">Objective</h4>
<p>The objective of this step is a critical phase in the data management process, primarily focused on ensuring the quality and usability of datasets within the project's framework. This stage involves a series of preprocessing steps designed to cleanse the datasets, removing any inconsistencies, errors, or irrelevant information that might hinder analysis. Since some datasets are updated daily, it's essential to establish automated data ingestion workflows, using tools like Apache NiFi, to streamline the continuous flow of data into the main database, Apache Druid. This approach facilitates the efficient and reliable updating of data and ensures that the datasets are in an optimal format and structure for analysis. The ultimate goal of this process is to enhance data accuracy and integrity, thereby enabling a deeper and more accurate understanding of the data, which is vital for informed decision-making and insightful analysis within the project.</p>
<h4 id="how-can-we-achieve-it_9">How can we achieve it?</h4>
<p>To successfully create workflows that can process the data into the desired format we have several ways to do it: creating a NiFi Flow, creating a python script or manually.
 - <strong>NiFi flow:</strong> Apache NiFi is a powerful tool that allows us to create data pipelines that can be scheduled to run periodically. This tool is very useful for data ingestion, as it allows us to fetch data from APIs, FTP servers, and other sources. Additionally, NiFi can be used to clean and transform data, ensuring that it is in the desired format and structure. Finally, NiFi can be used to load data into Apache Druid, ensuring that the data is correctly ingested into the database.
 - <strong>Python script:</strong> Develop Python scripts for more complex data transformations that might not be directly feasible within NiFi. This can include data cleaning, normalization, or feature engineering tasks. It can also be integrated with Apache NiFi to run as part of the flow. Furthermore, by using the Apache Druid API we can directly load data into the database.
 - <strong>Manually:</strong> For simple data transformations, it might be more efficient to perform them manually. This can include tasks such as renaming columns, changing data types, or removing columns. However, this approach is not scalable and should only be used for simple tasks.</p>
<p>Once the data is preprocessed and cleaned the analysis may be conducted by combining and exploring the data using Apache Superset and Apache Druid. Apache Superset is a powerful tool that allows us to create interactive dashboards and visualizations that will be explained in the next step. Apache Druid allows us to perform real-time analytics on large datasets. These tools will be used to explore the data and generate insights that will be used to answer the research questions.</p>

<h4 id="objective_11">Objective</h4>
<p>The objective in the "Generation of storylines for wide dissemination" phase is to craft engaging and accessible narratives that convey the project's key findings and insights to a broad audience. These storylines are designed to translate complex data and research outcomes into formats that are both engaging and easily understandable by the public. The aim is to underscore the project's significance and its potential impact on policy-making, community initiatives, and scientific research. By doing so, the goal is to foster increased public awareness and interest in the project, thereby enhancing its overall reach and influence. To achieve wide visibility and impact, these storylines will be disseminated through various media channels, tailored to resonate with diverse audience segments, thereby ensuring the project's findings are communicated effectively and broadly.</p>
<h4 id="how-can-we-achieve-it_11">How can we achieve it?</h4>
<p>To effectively generate storylines for wide dissemination, we will utilize a range of tools specified in our project documentation. The Communications and Outreach Team will collaborate closely with the Data Analysis Team, utilizing Apache Superset for creating compelling data visualizations that bring complex data to life in an easily digestible format. These visual elements will be integral in crafting storylines that are both informative and engaging to the public. Additionally, we will leverage WordPress and Discourse platforms to draft, refine, and share these narratives, ensuring they are tailored to resonate with diverse audience segments. The integration of these tools will enable us to effectively communicate the project's impact and findings through various media channels, from social media to press releases, thereby maximizing reach and fostering greater public engagement with the project's outcomes.</p>

<h4 id="responsible_12">Responsible</h4>
<p>Policy Analysis Team</p>
<h4 id="objective_12">Objective</h4>
<p>The generation of policy briefs for policymakers, a key objective of this project step, involves synthesizing research findings and data into clear, concise, and actionable recommendations. These briefs are crafted to effectively communicate pivotal insights and findings to policymakers, providing them with evidence-based guidance for policy interventions. By directly aligning with current policy debates and challenges, these briefs aim to bridge the gap between research and practical policymaking, offering solutions that are grounded in thorough data analysis. This approach not only enhances the relevancy of the research to ongoing policy discussions but also aims to significantly influence policy decisions and strategies, thus amplifying the overall impact of the project.</p>
<h4 id="how-can-we-achieve-it_12">How can we achieve it?</h4>
<p>To achieve this, we will first aggregate and analyze the data collected and insights generated throughout the project, using tools like Apache Druid for real-time analytics and Apache Superset for data visualization. These tools will help in identifying key trends and findings that are most relevant to policy-making. The policy analysis team will then work closely with research teams to distill these insights into policy briefs, ensuring that they are both data-driven and aligned with current policy needs. Communication specialists will refine these briefs to be clear and compelling, making them accessible to non-specialist policymakers. Throughout this process, project coordinators will ensure that the briefs align with the strategic objectives of the project and effectively convey its potential impact on policy and governance.</p>
