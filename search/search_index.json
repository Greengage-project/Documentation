Node.js and npm installed. Basic understanding of Keycloak, Docker, and Node.js. Project Structure Source: example example/ |-- docker-compose.yml |-- realm-export.json |-- keycloak.json |-- package.json |-- index.js |-- run.sh (for Linux/macOS) |-- run.bat (for Windows) Step 1: Setting Up Keycloak docker-compose.yml : This file contains the configuration to run a Keycloak container. Make sure the docker-compose.yml file is set up as provided in your project. realm-export.json : This file should be configured according to your Keycloak realm requirements. It contains realm, client, user, and role configurations. Step 2: Setting Up Node.js Application package.json : This file contains your project metadata and dependencies. Ensure express , express-session , and keycloak-connect dependencies are listed. index.js : This file contains your Express application setup. It sets up routes for login, logout, and the home page which displays the JWT. keycloak.json : This file contains the Keycloak client configuration. Update the realm , resource , and credentials fields with your Keycloak configuration. Installing Dependencies : Run the following command to install the necessary packages as listed in your package.json : npm i Step 3: Running the Services Linux/macOS : Ensure run.sh is executable: chmod +x run.sh . Execute run.sh to start the services: ./run.sh . Windows : Double-click run.bat or run it in the command prompt to start the services. Accessing the Application Navigate to localhost:3000/auth to log in using Keycloak. Once logged in, navigate to localhost:3000 to view the JWT and its decoded payload. To logout, navigate to localhost:3000/logout . Step 1: Install and Setup Keycloak Download and install Keycloak from the official website . Start Keycloak by navigating to the bin directory of your Keycloak installation and executing the standalone.sh (for Linux/macOS) or standalone.bat (for Windows) script. Access the Keycloak Admin Console at http://localhost:8080/auth and complete the initial setup. Create an admin user for managing Keycloak. Step 2: Create a Realm and a Client (OpenID Connect) Create a New Realm: Navigate to the Keycloak Admin Console. Click on \"Add realm\" to create a new realm. Enter the required details for your realm and save. Register a Client: Navigate to Clients and click Create . Provide a Client ID , and select the Client Protocol as openid-connect . Select the Client Access Type as confidential if your client is a web application that can secure the client secret. Otherwise, select public if your client is a native app or a JavaScript app running in the browser. Set Standard Flow Enabled to ON if you want to use the Authorization Code Flow which is recommended for most scenarios. Configure OpenID Connect Protocol: For each client, you can tailor what claims and assertions are stored in the OIDC token by creating and configuring protocol mappers. You may need to set up JSON mapping for certain claim keys in your application to handle roles or other claims passed by Keycloak. Client Adapters: Install a Keycloak Adapter in your application environment to communicate and be secured by Keycloak. Keycloak provides adapters for different platforms, and there are also third-party adapters available. Test Your Setup: At this point, it would be prudent to test your setup by attempting to authenticate using OpenID Connect. There are various grant types supported by Keycloak for authenticating users including authorization code, implicit, and client credentials. Additional Configuration (Optional): Depending on your application's requirements, you might need to configure additional settings in Keycloak or in your application. For instance, you might need to set up user roles, groups, and permissions, or configure multi-factor authentication. Documentations and Tutorials: There are various resources available that provide step-by-step guides or tutorials on integrating OpenID Connect with Keycloak, including the Keycloak official documentation . This extended step should provide a more thorough understanding of how to integrate OpenID Connect with Keycloak. However, the exact steps might vary based on your application's technology stack and your specific requirements. Step 3: Configure your System For a JavaScript application, you could use the Keycloak JavaScript adapter. npm install keycloak-js or a middleware as keycloak-connect npm install keycloak-connect Configure the library with the details of your Keycloak realm and client. // Example configuration for a JavaScript application const keycloak = Keycloak({ url: \"http://localhost:8080/auth\", realm: \"<your-realm>\", clientId: \"<your-client-id>\", }); Step 4: Integrate Authentication Use the library to add authentication to your system. For a web application, this would typically involve redirecting unauthenticated users to the Keycloak login page, and handling the tokens returned by Keycloak upon successful authentication. // Example integration for a JavaScript application keycloak .init({ onLoad: \"login-required\" }) .then((authenticated) => { console.log(authenticated ? \"Authenticated\" : \"Not authenticated\"); }) .catch((error) => { console.error(\"Failed to initialize authentication\", error); }); Step 5: Integrate Authorization Use the tokens obtained during authentication to make authorized requests to your system's backend, and to check the user's roles and permissions. // Example authorization check in a JavaScript application if (keycloak.hasRealmRole(\"admin\")) { console.log(\"User is an admin\"); } This tutorial provides a high-level overview of the steps involved in integrating Keycloak with your system. The exact steps and code may vary depending on the specifics of your system and the programming languages and frameworks you are using. Python Prerequisites Docker and Docker Compose installed.

MODE provides the missing link for the development of innovative mobility services: automatic, reliable recognition of the means of transport used, and travelled routes using smartphones. Features of MODE MODE is a trip recording and mode detection framework. It consists of two main software components: 1. A data recording module for iOS and Android Apps 2. A backend data analysis module The above figure shows a high-level overview and demonstrates how to embed the MODE components into a system (AIT components are highlighted in blue, other components must be provided by a partner). Client-side tracking and data recording functionality can be added to an existing App by including the libMODE library. Once the library is configured and activated (see Frontend ), it tracks user activity and records relevant movement data. The library transmits completed trips to a backend server using REST calls (REST API, see section \"REST API\"). On the server side, the transmitted trip data can be processed using the AIT JMDCA library. The JMDCA library is written in Java and provides core data structures, processing routines and analysis algorithms which allow application programmers to easily analyse trips and perform mode detection on the recorded data (JMDCA API, see section Backend ). To deliver high-quality results, the JMDCA mode detection algorithm requires access to a third-party public transit routing engine (such as HERE or Google routing). The result of using MODE are trips. These trips can include multiple segments (\"legs\") which make up a trip. E.g. if a user walks to his or her car, then drives to a transit station and then takes the train to reach the destination it would yield three legs, each with: Start and end times The travel mode (e.g. bike, car, public transport, walking, etc.) The probability of the \"correctness\" (e.g. it could be \"LOW; Reason: Bad GPS signal\") Use Case Scenario The main usage of MODE is to be integrated in smartphone apps to track user travel behavior.

Therefore this integration document is split in two sections Frontend and Backend. Frontend The MODE smartphone library ( libMODE ) provides a complete, out-of-the-box solution for mobility data collection via smartphones. It is built as an autonomous component that can easily be integrated into third party apps. For the standard use-case (trip data collection) the library can be integrated into existing Apps with little effort: Step 1: Add the library to the App as a build dependency The most recent version of the libMODE library will be provided by AIT upon request . The library can be added to the App by adding a corresponding dependency to the build. The following example shows how to add libMODE to the build.gradle of an Android App. TODO: Show example. Step 2: Initialize the library and start data collection The library needs to be initialized before it can start recording data: @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { Context ctx = getApplicationContext(); Mode.initialize(ctx); // Optional: allow data uploading via cellular network (otherwise data only gets uploaded when on WiFi) Mode.getConfigurationEntry(Configuration.CONFIG_METERED_UPLOADING_ALLOWED).setBooleanValue(ctx, true); // set Backend Server Mode.setBaseServerURL(\"http://localhost:8080\"); // Set OAUTH2 token manually Mode.setAuthorizationToken(\"MY_OAUTH2_TOKEN\"); // ... OR use libMODE authentication to login a user /* String USERNAME = \"hannes\"; String PASSWORD = \"somepassword\"; Mode.getUser(USERNAME, userResult -> { Mode.provideUserPassword(PASSWORD, userResult, passwordResult -> { if (passwordResult.isSuccess()) { System.out.println(\"Logged in\"); } else { throw new IllegalStateException(\"Login failed\"); } }); }); */ // Start Mode.startSurvey(); } The following steps must be taken by the client code: - request permission to record location data ANDROID_PERMISSION_ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION - initialize libMODE - start recording We provide an example demo-project on demand. Backend The backend is provided on demand as a Docker image which opens the rest service on port 8080. Step 1: Configuring Your Service TODO: How to - Steps to incorporate the received credentials into the service. - Guidelines on setting up the service for proper communication with the [Tool Name]. Step 2: Testing the Integration TODO!! (we will provide sample data) - Instructions for testing the integration to ensure everything is set up correctly. - Contact information for support in case of issues during testing. Output If the front end and backend works correctly, the backend will spit out the resulting trips as a JSON file: { \"message\": \"success\", \"activities\": [ { \"begin\": \"2020-07-15T13:20:41.059Z\", \"end\": \"2020-07-15T13:45:37.059Z\", \"mode\": \"WALK\", \"modeDetails\": \" | Sensor mode Walk | GPSQuality(AVERAGE : time gap)\", \"distanceMeters\": 1253.2470899042082, \"route\": \"ue`eHkddcB??????????rCrAj@Vj@Vh@Th@Vp@Xj@Xp@Xh@Tl@Vl@XJDp@Xn@Xp@Vp@XJDl@Tn@Rp@RRB@@D@?@?@???@???@@????????@???A?????????????????????????????????@????????????????????????Nh@??@E??@??@@B@B@B@@ACAAAC?AM]EICGCE?A???@?@BFBH@DP`A@F?D???B????A@A???EA??A??A????A@??????A????AA????CAI@??A@????A????????@?????B@B?D?B?F@D?B?H@H?F?D@B?@?@????C?CAC?CAGAGCG?CAA?AAA@??ABABCBABAB?@?@?BBBBD@D@F?DCDCBCBEBEBC@EBEBC@EBEBC@EBC@CBCBCBCBCBEBC@EBE@C@C@ABCBCBEBCBE@E@G@G@EBEBEBGBEBG@GBG@G?G?E?ECCEAEAEAECEECECEEECEECECCCCECCECCACACAEACAECECEEECEECCEEECECECECECEEECECECEAECEAECGCGCEEECE?C@CBE@C?CCECC?E?CBCFADCFCDABC@A@A?@A????A?A??@A???@A??@A??????@??A?@@?@??????A?A?AA???????????A?@???????@??@???@A??@?A???A@A?A??????@A??A??@A@???@???@?B????@??A?AA????A?????????A???@?????@?@?@?@?@A??@??????A???@@?A?A???????????A???A?A??????????@??@???A??@A???A@?A??@?@A@?@?@????@????A?????A?A?A?????A??????A????DA??????A??@????A???@??@?????@??A?????????@??????A?????CAAA?AAAA@???@A?????????@@@@?@????@@???????????????A?????????A???AA????????A?????A???@@@??@A?????A?@?????@??A?A@A@A@????@I@????B?@?A@??@?@ABCBA@A???\" }, { \"begin\": \"2020-07-15T13:45:38.059Z\", \"end\": \"2020-07-15T13:51:20.059Z\", \"mode\": \"BUS\", \"modeDetails\": \"Line 69A (Hauptbahnhof - Simmering) (BUS) from Am Kanal to Arsenalsteg | Sensor mode Bus routed to Bus | GPSQuality(GOOD)\", \"distanceMeters\": 2143.843162687046, \"route\": \"ch_eHk_dcB????yA`ByAxA??gBbB??}AlA??{BrA??cBp@uBn@??cBZ??s@`C????????????????????AnD??ElC??EjCGlC??EtB??EtBGtB??IxD??KpC????????????????????A`D??IdE????c@xC??_AlB??CzC??m@lC??_AbB????????????qA`C????wBxD??_BfC??wAzB????}A~B????????????????iAbB??gAdB??gB`C??q@~@s@~@s@~@KW\" }, { \"begin\": \"2020-07-15T13:51:29.059Z\", \"end\": \"2020-07-15T14:32:45.059Z\", \"mode\": \"WALK\", \"modeDetails\": \" | Sensor mode Walk | GPSQuality(BAD : large time gap)\", \"distanceMeters\": 1435.4269300101091, \"route\": \"mhaeHq{_cBE^@?AAACEAEAE?E?C?CACCCAC?E?CACCAG?CBEBABA@CBCBAB?@D?@?BCFA@C@CBAB?B@B@@@A@C@C@A@@@B?DABAB?B?@@@??@?BABA@?@?@B?D?D@D@F@D@D@F@F@D@FBD@F@FBH@FBHBFBFBFBHBF@HBF@DBF@FBDBDBDBFBD@FBD@D?B?@???????A??????????????@@?B@DBDBF@DBFBDBFBD@FBDBFBFBDBDBDBFBDBFBFBDBFBD@F@FBFBDB@DAD?DAB@D@B@@@A@CBC@CB?BDBFBF@FBD@BDBB@F@F@H?H@H@H@HBHBF@DBF@DBFBBDDDBDBDBDDBDBFBDDFBD@FBFBD@FBFBDBFBDDDDFDFBDDDBDBDBBBBBDBBBBD@B@DABABEBCBCBE@G@G@G@GBE@EBG@E?G@G?E@G?E@GBE@IBGBGDGBGBEBG@E@E@G@E@G@G@G@E@G@G?E@G?G@EBEBEBEBAD?D@FBDBBDDD@F@B@D?D@B?B@B@B??DJ?@@@?@B@LLDBFB@@@?@@@???@@@?@@@???@@@???@@@?@?@@??@@@?@?@@??@?@@@@DBB@NZ?@?@@@?@@??@?@?@@??@??@B??????????????AA???????A????EM??AC????AC?A???A????CG?AAC????????CI?AAA?A???????A??A????A??AE?????AA????A?????AAA?AAC?????A??????AAAE???A????M_@AACEAA??A??AAA??AAA?AA??MKAACCCACCECCCCACCEECCEAE?E@EDEDEFCDAHCHAHAHAH?FAF?DADCBADADAF?FAHAFAFAFAF?H?FAF?FAFCFCDCFCDCDCDEDCBEDCBCDAFCF?FAF@F?FAD?DADAFADCBADCDCDCDAFCDAFADAFCDCDCDCBADADADCDADCDADCFAH?HAF?HAF?F?H?F@FAD?FCFADAHAFAFAFAHAFADCFAF?D?F?D?D?FADADAFAFCFCHAFCFCHCDCFCDEBEDEBEDC@E?EACCEECACCCACCCCCCACCCCCCECCACCCACACA@A@A@?@?@?@?@?????????A??A?A?A?A?@@@?????????@?????@A@ABU??EH?@A@?@ABEJ?@ABA@CHW|@K^ADAH?@?????C?????A???@?????A?E?A?C?????J?@????A?@????????@???A????????????\" } ] } The format uses google encoded strings for the polylines of the trips.
